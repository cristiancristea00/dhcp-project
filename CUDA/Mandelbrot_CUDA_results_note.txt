Mandelbrot Performance Measurement

Time Measurement Methods:
std::chrono: Measures the total time from kernel launch to completion, including CPU-GPU synchronization and potential overhead.
cudaEvent:   Measures only the GPU kernel execution time, providing a more accurate kernel performance measurement.


Running Times (in milliseconds) on 5000×3000 Images for 1000 Iterations:
Note: The times are the average of 10 consecutive runs.
